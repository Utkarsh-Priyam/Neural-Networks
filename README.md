# Neural Networks
This is my repository for all code related to the neural networks class I took in 11th grade.

The repository will be updated to back up my work and reflect my work path through the class.
##
This repository is completely in [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/).

If you would like a [python](https://www.python.org/) version of this code base, check out [this](https://github.com/rishab-partha/Neural-Networks) repository by Rishab Parthasarathy.

If you have taken this class and have well-written code in [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/) or another popular language, contact me so I can set up a link to your repository as well.
##
This repository is public but will only be updated sporadically.

There may be some mild swearing (in commit names, JavaDoc, etc.).
##
This repository can be used as a reference on how basic multi-layer perceptrons could be set up.

By accessing this repository, you agree to take any and all responsibility for any consequences that may arise from accusations of plagiarism or theft. Do NOT copy any code from this repository.
