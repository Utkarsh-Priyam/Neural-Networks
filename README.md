# Neural Networks
This is my repository for all code related to the neural networks class I took in 11th grade.

The repository will be updated to back up my work and reflect my work path through the class.
##
This repository is completely in [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/).

If you would like a [python](https://www.python.org/) version of this code base, check out [this](https://github.com/rishab-partha/Neural-Networks) repository by Rishab Parthasarathy.

If you have taken this class and have code in [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/) for this class, contact me so I can set up a link to your repository as well.
##
This repository is public but will only be updated sporadically.

There may be some mild swearing (in commit names, JavaDoc, etc.). If you don't like it find another public neural networks repository.
##
This repository is simply for reference on how a basic multi-layer perceptron could be set up.

DO NOT COPY THIS CODE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, WITH OR WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

IF YOU COPY CODE FROM THIS REPOSITORY, YOU ARE SOLELY REPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING FROM PLAGIARISM, ETC.
