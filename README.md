# Neural Networks
This is my repository for all code related to the neural networks class I took in 11th grade.

The repository will be updated to back up my work and reflect my work path through the class.
##
This repository is completely in [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/).

If you would like a [python](https://www.python.org/) version of this code base, check out [this](https://github.com/rishab-partha/Neural-Networks) repository by Rishab Parthasarathy.  
For a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) version, check out [this](https://github.com/g10ria/ATCS-Neural-Networks) repository by Gloria Zhu.

If you have taken this class and have well-written code in another popular language such as [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/), contact me so I can set up a link to your repository as well.
##
This repository is public but will only be sporadically updated.

There may be some mild swearing (in commit names, JavaDoc, etc.).
##
This repository can be used as a reference for how basic multi-layer perceptrons can be set up.
